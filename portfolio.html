                <p>During the wireframing process, the initial goal was to discover the flow between screens, as well as the basic functionality of the drone delivery service. At this stage of production, it was vital to implement the most important features of the application. This ensured, that any future additions or changes could be efficiently adapted to each salient feature.
					<br>
					<br>
The steps user undertake during the delivery process, was heavily influenced from the Uber app. Once a destination has been set, the user is prompted to select a weight package tier. Next, a delivery route is showcased to the users along side a confirmation screen. When the package has been loaded, an updated delivery route is shown. 
					<br>
					<br>
With influence from user testing, the most efficient path for the delivery process was achieved. To provide the best user experience, the number of steps were minimized, while only conveying information directly relevant to users. For this reason, drone flight speed and package status were mitigated.
					<br>
					<br>
The most challenging factor when designing for the application, was in the logistics behind sender and receiver. Extra care was needed in designing the interface in what the receiver needed to see and what the sender needed to see. Also, the next iteration of the interface would need to adapt for circumstances when the user is ordering multiple deliveries and how the interface would showcase that.

              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>The goal for iteration two was expanding on the original concept by introducing stylized features. Illustrations and use of colour, helped emphasize areas of importance on screen. To showcase a change in drone tiers differing sizes and styles, in the visualization, were added. Furthermore, Iconography better visualized drone flights paths on route.
					<br>
					<br>
To provide further insight into the delivery process, a real-world scenario was established in the form of a storyboard. Storyboarding helped visualize the approach before, during and after the delivery process. Observing a scenario, where an individual would be using the application to send a package to another person, allowed us to adapt unforeseen concerns. For this reason, a screen was added for the drone landing sequence.

This iteration saw a fundamental change in the selection process for drone delivery destinations. Rather than showcasing addresses, contacts were utilized instead. Due to the peer to peer nation of the app, it made sense that deliveries would be between individuals rather than from person to physical location.

                <p>The final iteration introduced overall refinements across the user interface. The overarching goal was to introduce consistency in visual elements as well as the overall functionality.  With that, the introduction of animations helped bridge the flow between screens within the application.
					<br>
					<br>
The method by which users select package weight and size has changed for the final integration. Users usually know little about the approximate weight and or dimensions of their item. For this reason, a slider was Implemeted, cycling from small and light items to larger more heavier items instead. This eliminates the problem, where individuals would have to guess which weight tier they would need to select.
					<br>
					<br>
To cut down the time it takes to initiate a delivery, contacts were added in the form of circles on the home screen. When tapped, users are presented with the option of starting a delivery from the get-go.
					<br>
					<br>
The final iteration now allows users to book multiple deliveries. Ordered by time, users can swipe up from the bottom of the screen and monitor the status of their packages. Once the drone arrives in the proximity of the intended destination, users are now prompted to accept the delivery and choose an appropriate landing area. This added feature, limits the chance of theft or vandalism, as only the receiver has total control.
					<br>
					<br>
The task that proved most challenging was implementing appropriate animations for the user interface. Animations saw multiple revisions, as they detracted too much from the content on page and appeared sporadic. The finalized animations now express a sense of professionalism while guiding the users eyes throughout the delivery process.
