                <p>This process journal provides a reflection on the developments and transition from an autonomous tourism transportation service to peer-to-peer drone delivery. The transition from concept ideation to research and findings was developed in relation to autonomous transportation in the tourism industry. My involvement in the peer-to-peer delivery service began from synthesis and wireframing to the very end of high-fidelity prototyping.
					<br>
					<br>
The project began as an app-based service, available to travelers, who have the desire to explore and participate in activities by their own terms and in a time frame of their choosing. The main aim was to provide individuals with unlimited flexibility and the ability for the user to choose what they want to see rather than limited options offered by travel organizations.
					<br>
					<br>
Moving into the peer-to-peer drone delivery service, the aim was to provide the quickest and most convenient form of delivery from person to person, negating all the usual downfalls from existing car-based services. For the moment the application is solely peer to peer, however expansion into more commercial and governmental sectors could see a drastic change in the delivery industry.

                <p>At the beginning of our design process, we began examining each autonomous vehicular option and brainstormed several ideas we could pursue. We investigated: Late night autonomous vehicle services with a focus on those under the influence, an autonomous vehicle service with a focus on tourism, and drones that would allow businesses to examine crowds with a focus on flow management.
Next, we compiled a list of pros and cons for each potential idea. With intense analyzation of each option, we decided to pursue the idea of autonomous transportation in the tourism industry. The reasoning behind our choice was mainly due to our keen interest in tour services and previous experiences in rideshare services overseas. It felt fitting pursuing a venture in autonomous ridesharing, as it would allow us to undertake current issues in tour like services, with a focus on ridesharing, due to prior negative experiences e.g. language barriers.
					<br>
					<br>
By working on a service, which combines autonomous transportation and tourism, we could provide a service allowing travellers to see and experiencing more, while spending less time overall.
					<br>
					<br>
The next step in our design process was in examining appropriate research methods we could take advantage of and the possible questions we could convey. At this stage, the team and I began background research in competitive rideshare services, the technology used in autonomous vehicles and statistical data in the tourism sector.

                <p>Looking at statistics in the tourism industry, not only are a higher number of tourists visiting Australia, but people are staying longer, while on holiday. Future growth projections see the majority of tourists originating from China, India and Japan so the application would need to accommodate to the needs of a foreign audience.
				<br>
				<br>
We also looked into autonomous technologies developed by leaders in the industry. This allowed us to get a general sense on how to approach our service similarly, while avoiding the downfalls faced by competitors such as Uber.
				<br>
				<br>
In this stage of the project we began conducting our own user research. We decided on user surveys to gain quantitative data and interviews for qualitative data. Questions that were more closed ended were integrated into our online user survey. Whereas the more open-ended questions would be incorporated into interviews. Interviews were chosen as one of our research methods, as we wanted to gain a detailed insight on the current state of tourism and the types of transport used while overseas. Similar to the interviews, the survey would focus on how individuals travel overseas, as well as the highs and lows of their experiences. The questions placed emphasis on specific taste in what a good tourism or rideshare service should entail. 
				<br>
				<br>
Our surveys were distributed through Facebook and WeChat, to ensure good data collection from a variety of different audiences. Moreover, our interviews were held at University, which allowed us to capture relevant data from our target audience. One student was of international origin, the other a local student.
				
				<br>
				<br>
Summarizing the key insights, users expressed the need for our service to be more accommodating, allowing more flexibility than most tour services. Half of the research participants were unable to thoroughly explore all desired areas while on holiday, due to time constraints and hurdles in day management. A tour like experience should be highly customizable and accommodate to the tastes and preferences of its users. Along site other vita data from the user survey and interviews, information was compiled into individual sticky notes and built up into an affinity diagram.

				<br>
				<br>
In the days leading up to the research report, we began work on our user personas. Their personalities were derived from the main takeaways of our demographic data in our interviews and surveys. This then directly influenced our storyboard.
				<br>
				<br>
The final steps involved developing the project’s journey map. The journey map would focus on the typical issues travelers face when venturing to a planned sight or activity while on holiday.

When designing the application, it is clear customization, accommodation and safety should take center stage.
					<br>
					<br>
Overall, with research participants expressing the need for greater independence in tour like services, the application would need to accommodate to the desires of users. Allowing users to choose what they would like to see around a city, at times of their chose, would be of great importance to users.
					<br>
					<br>
The service would also have to accommodate to the desires of its audience. Perhaps integrating features that allow a change in taste or experiences before and throughout the journey would satisfy users. For example, ordering varying vehicle sizes, types or interior styles and in car tour related entertainment.
					<br>
					<br>
Finally, giving users access to finer control around safety and vehicle maneuverability would alleviate the issue of trust associated with autonomous vehicles.

                <p>At this point, I was unable to continue with the project, with my team member discontinuing the course for the time being. I was therefore transferred to a new group and had to shift my focus to a new concept. To make the transition less troublesome, I summarized the key takeaways from my results, so that it could be easily integrated into their project. Although their concept was somewhat unrelated to mine, I was still able to add some perspective on safetyand trust in regard to autonomous vehicles.</p>

                <p>With the start of a new project, key insights were somewhat integrated into the new concept. At this point, I thought it would be appropriate in examining the work already conducted by the group, making notes on how to orientate myself to the new scheme.
					<br>
					<br>
Moving along, the team showcased and explained their app sketches. Ideas were traded, and a list was created, based on which features were ideal for the next iteration and what needed more work. Eventually we settled on the on the design for the app, leading in to the creation of the paper prototypes for low fidelity testing. Once the paper prototypes were finished, we established a user scenario for a test subject to accomplish. We asked a participant to complete a task we had set, so that we could observe if our UI was intuitive enough to move forward with.
					<br>
					<br>
The focus of the projected moved into hand sketched wireframing for the project. With further development, new features and additions to the UI, we tested our initial hand sketched wireframe on two participants. We were able draw out any shortcomings as well as the positive aspects to our design. Each member was required to examine what users liked and disliked and work on ways to improve our current build.

We noticed, that the flow between screens made sense, following a similar pattern to Ubers application. However, we found the targets, users were required to touch, required added detail, as it was somewhat vague. Moreover, because the service was intended to be peer to peer, showcasing ‘work’ and ‘home’ as destinations did not make sense. Finally, users wanted better pricing information, clearer distinctions between weight tiers and a more detailed delivery route on map.

                <p>Based on user feedback, the interface was iterated into a medium fidelity prototype, showcasing developed UI illustrations and an improved appearance. The interface was evaluated using Nielsen’s Heuristics, examining the major strengths and weaknesses.
					<br>
					<br>
A strength to our interface was that it informed users relatively well on the location and ETA of the drone throughout the Journey. However, some users want a more detailed breakdown of the ETA . Rather than only displaying the total delivery ETA, times between milestones within the journey might be beneficial to both the sender and receiver.

This data would help iterate on our design as we move into the medium fidelity prototype phase of the project. 
The next part of the iteration process involved creating two concise and evolved storyboards based on prior ones. The group decided upon a scenario, that would showcase the key actions participants would undertake within the application. One storyboard would focus on the processes involved when sending a package to an individual. The second process involved a scenario, where an individual would request an item be sent to them via a drone.

                <p>Upon the creation of our medium fidelity prototype, we began user testing of our final medium fidelity prototype. We gave users the task of ordering a drone from one user in another location to your location on the app. We helped visualize the drone by hovering a box over the participants heads. They were required to think aloud, providing any in the moment feedback as they could. The test concluded with post think aloud questions, primarily asking what they liked, didn’t like, what they would improve and what they would add.

Regarding search, we learnt that users wanted the search box to be located towards the bottom, as it was difficult to reach. Also, we decided upon the word ‘search’ within the search space as previous wording was confusing to users.
					<br>
					<br>
For Contacts, users wanted a quicker and more intuitive delivery process. We added circles on the map with their initials within. When tapped, a card pops up to reveal relevant information and the ability to start a delivery.
<img src="C:\Users\olive\Documents\GitHub\Task-3-ofro2453\Process Journal Images\High fidelity\wireflow.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
The way users deliver to and from a person is now done by contacts, rather than a list of addresses. This would lessen confusion, as deliveries to and from users would never solely take place in just one physical location, it would take place over multiple.
<img src="C:\Users\olive\Documents\GitHub\Task-3-ofro2453\Process Journal Images\High fidelity\sketch.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
We also changed the way users selected package weight and size. Because users generally know little about the approximate weight and or dimensions of their item, we implemented a slider, which cycles from small and light items to larger more heavier items, instead. This eliminates the problem, where individuals would have to guess which weight tier they would need to select.
					<br>
					<br>
Our final design change was to display the entire route to the user. Before only sections of the route were displayed at separate times, which was confusing to users. Animations showing the direction of travel, will help users understand the direction of travel the drone will move.

                <p>The final advancements for the final iteration of the hi fidelity wireframes were the addition of responsive animations showing the flow between screens. The main goal with the introduction of animation was to draw users’ eyes to vital areas on screen while also better highlighting the stages within the delivery process. Furthermore, iteration 3 allowed for further refinement of the design, while ironing out inconsistencies that were previously unknown.
					<br>
					<br>
Finally, we added a hamburger menu which housed new features and common sections found within applications. For example, in addition to settings, updating contacts and changing your payment method, we introduced the ability to schedule deliveries. This new feature would help those who prefer planning their deliveries well in advance.
					<br>
					<br>
The most difficult aspects were implementing professional consistent animations within the prototype.  Also, it proved challenging fine adjusting minor animations due to the limitations of the software. In the future, using more sophisticated applications, such as ProtoPie, could result in more refined animations.
					<br>
					<br>
Nevertheless, we found success in the overall functionality and design of the application. With further development, new aspects such as communal based deliveries, could into even greater potential for our application.
